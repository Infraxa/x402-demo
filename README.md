**Built by [infraxa.ai](https://infraxa.ai)** - Enabling internet-native micro-payments for HTTP resources

---

## üåü What is x402?

x402 is an open payment protocol that enables **micro-payments for HTTP resources** using the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code. It provides a standardized way to monetize digital content with automatic revenue splitting, minimal integration complexity, and sub-second settlement times.

### Key Features

- üí∞ **Micro-Payments** - Start at $0.001 with 2-second settlement
- ‚ö° **Gasless** - No gas fees for clients or resource servers
- üîÑ **Automatic Revenue Split** - Configurable 4-way split on every transaction
- üîó **Chain Agnostic** - Supports EVM networks and Solana
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy Integration** - 1 line for server, 1 function for client
- üîê **Decentralized** - Permissionless and trust-minimizing
- üåê **HTTP Native** - Seamlessly complements existing HTTP requests

## üéØ Revenue Splitting

Every payment is automatically split according to your configuration:

| Recipient | Percentage | Example (0.01 SOL) |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Platform Fee** | 2% | 0.0002 SOL |
| **Network Fee** | 3% | 0.0003 SOL |
| **Creator Share** | 30% | 0.003 SOL |
| **Content Owner** | 65% | 0.0065 SOL |

*Revenue splits are configurable and executed automatically on-chain.*

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Phantom wallet browser extension
- Devnet SOL from [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/infraboy/x402-demo.git
cd x402-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the demo.

### Configuration

The demo is configured for **Solana Devnet** by default. Key configuration files:

- **`src/components/PaymentDemo.tsx`** - Line 8: `RPC_URL = 'https://api.devnet.solana.com'`
- **`src/lib/x402.ts`** - Lines 7-11: Program ID and wallet addresses

**To switch to Mainnet:**
1. Update `RPC_URL` to `'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'`
2. Ensure all wallet addresses are funded on mainnet
3. Test thoroughly with small amounts first
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Use at your own risk - verify all transactions before signing**

## üí° How It Works

### Payment Flow

1. **Client Requests Resource** ‚Üí Server responds with `402 Payment Required`
2. **User Connects Wallet** ‚Üí Phantom wallet integration
3. **Payment Created** ‚Üí Client creates payment payload with cryptographic signature
4. **Verification** ‚Üí Server verifies payment with facilitator service
5. **Settlement** ‚Üí Payment is executed on-chain with automatic revenue split
6. **Content Delivered** ‚Üí User receives access to premium content

### Integration Example

**Server-side (Next.js):**
```typescript
import { x402Middleware } from 'x402-next';

export default x402Middleware({
  amount: '0.01',
  currency: 'SOL',
  splits: {
    platform: 0.02,
    network: 0.03,
    creator: 0.30,
    owner: 0.65
  }
});
```

**Client-side:**
```typescript
import { createX402Client } from 'x402-fetch';

const client = createX402Client();
const response = await client.fetch('/premium-content');
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js
- **Wallet**: Phantom Wallet SDK
- **Smart Contract**: Rust + Pinocchio
- **Protocol**: x402 HTTP Payment Standard

### Smart Contract Details

- **Program ID**: `5g8XvMcpWEgHitW7abiYTr1u8sDasePLQnrebQyCLPvY`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet (‚ö†Ô∏è **Also deployed on Mainnet**)
- **Platform Wallet**: `8XLmbY1XRiPzeVNRDe9FZWHeCYKZAzvgc1c4EhyKsvEy`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT WARNING**: This demo uses the same Program ID for both devnet and mainnet. When deploying to production, ensure you update the RPC endpoint and thoroughly test all transactions. **No liability will be borne for incorrect usage, lost funds, or any damages resulting from the use of this code.** Always verify transactions on the correct network before signing.
